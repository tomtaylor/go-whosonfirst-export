# go-whosonfirst-export

Go package for exporting Who's On First documents.

## Important

Too soon. Move along.

## What is this?

This is an experimental package to format Who's On First documents in Go. It is meant to be a port of the [py-mapzen-whosonfirst-geojson](https://github.com/whosonfirst/py-mapzen-whosonfirst-geojson) package and _mmmmmmmaybe_ some or all of the [py-mapzen-whosonfirst-export](https://github.com/whosonfirst/py-mapzen-whosonfirst-geojson) package.

It is also in flux and you should assume anything you see or read now _will_ change.
